        <div class="questions">
          <p class="question">Q1: What is Progressive Jackpot slot?</p>
          <p>A: Most slots have a Jackpot, but there’s a big difference between the regular ones and Progressive Jackpot slots. The difference is that with a regular slot, the Jackpot is 
            always the same value, while with a Progressive Jackpot slot, the amount is constantly increasing until it’s won.</p>
          <p class="question">Q2: What are Free Spins?</p>
          <p>A: In the world of slots, free spins can mean two very different things. Firstly, they can mean free spins awarded to a player by the casino itself, as a reward. They’re free in that the casino will not charge the player to spin them rather than the player. Players often have the option in a promotion to receive free spins or just be awarded and the free spins as soon as they log in.
             The casino normally decides what slot free spins must be played on.</p>
          <p class="question">Q3: What is Scatter symbol?</p>
          <p>A: A Scatter is a special symbol present in slots whose purpose is normally to activate the free spins round.Sometimes it can appear anywhere on the reels, other times it only appears on Reels 1, 3, and 5. 
             players generally need to get at least three Scatters to start the free spins round.</p>
          <p class="question">Q4: What is Wild symbol?</p>
          <p>A: Almost all slots have a Wild symbol, which serves a very different purpose to the Scatter symbol.The Wild symbol normally substitutes for any symbol other than the Scatter.</p>
